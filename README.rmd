## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
mecha_car<-read.csv('MechaCar_mpg.csv')

lm(mecha_car$mpg~mecha_car$AWD +
  mecha_car$ground_clearance +
  mecha_car$spoiler_angle +
  mecha_car$vehicle_length +
  mecha_car$vehicle_weight,
                 mecha_car) %>%
    summary()

```

All-wheel drive and spoiler angle seem to have the most significance to mpg. The slope is not 0 since the p-value is less than 0.05. From our linear model, the r-squared is 0.71, which means that roughly 71% of all mpg predictions will be correct when using this linear model.
